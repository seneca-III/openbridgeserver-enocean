"""Regenerate tests/fixtures/timer_value_parity.json from the backend implementation.

The fixture pins the Zeitschaltuhr switching-value contract (issue #1008) across all
three implementations — `obs/models/types.py`, `gui/src/utils/timerValue.js` and
`frontend/src/utils/timerValue.ts`. Run this after changing the backend parser, then
re-run the three test suites; a frontend that now accepts something the backend
rejects will fail its parity test.

Usage:  tools/with-venv python tools/gen-timer-value-parity-fixture.py
