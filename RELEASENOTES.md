# Changes

## 2026.7.0
### Breaking changes 🚨
* none

### New features ✨
* Backend: ETS hierarchy import logic is now available as a reusable backend service while keeping `POST /api/v1/hierarchy/import-from-ets` behavior unchanged. This prepares the KNX project import to create selected ETS hierarchies in the same import flow. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/727
* Backend: `.knxproj` imports can now create selected ETS hierarchies in the same backend request, reporting per-hierarchy node/link counts and non-fatal failures for unavailable ETS data. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/728
* Admin GUI: `.knxproj` imports now offer hierarchy creation for topology, buildings/rooms, and trades in the same import flow, including per-hierarchy result feedback and optional auto-linking to created objects. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/729

## 2026.6.0
### Breaking changes 🚨
* Security: Backend URL fetches from logic API-client nodes, iCalendar nodes, Pushover `image_url` attachments, the camera proxy, and the weather API now block private/local network targets by default unless they are explicitly allowlisted. Migration: existing installations using LAN cameras such as `http://192.168.x.x/...`, local `.ics` calendars, local Pushover image sources, or a local weather endpoint must allowlist the target under Settings → Security → URL Target Allowlist, or in the YAML file configured by `security.url_target_allowlist_path` (default: `OBS_SECRET_FILE_DIR/url-target-allowlist.yaml` when `OBS_SECRET_FILE_DIR` is set, otherwise `secrets/url-target-allowlist.yaml` next to the configured database). Use an IP address or CIDR for private targets, for example `192.168.1.23/32` or `10.38.113.0/24`. If a hostname such as `internal.example` resolves to a private IP address, allowlist the resolved IP/CIDR; a hostname-only entry does not override private-IP blocking and does not bypass DNS validation. Until the target is allowlisted, affected camera widgets, weather widgets, iCalendar nodes, Pushover image attachments, or logic API-client calls are intentionally blocked. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/700
* Security: Support-package creation and temporary debug-log controls are now admin-only. The regular in-memory log API remains available to authenticated users and API keys, and live `log_entry` WebSocket messages follow the same authenticated read access. Generated support packages sanitize credentials, endpoints, IPs/domains, paths, and log details before export. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/737

### Known Issues 🔔
* History DB with SQlite should only used for development environments. No testing, no production, we will remove this feature in the future.

### Fixes 🐞
* Backend: Hierarchy selections now respect the configured display start level consistently in dropdowns, chips, datapoint filters, and datapoint hierarchy assignments; deeper levels remain navigable while full paths stay available for disambiguation. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/717
* Adapter: Fixed Modbus TCP bindings stopping to poll after a binding is deleted and recreated (e.g. when changing scale_factor or data_format). Root cause: `t.cancel()` without `asyncio.gather()` allowed old and new poll tasks to read the shared TCP socket concurrently, corrupting the stream. Fix includes: (1) await gather() so old tasks finish before new ones start; (2) always close+reconnect after reload for a clean TCP session; (3) auto-reconnect with `_reconnect_lock` in the poll loop; (4) unified I/O semaphore `_io_sem` covering both reads *and* writes so DEST writes cannot interleave with SOURCE reads; (5) `disconnect()` also awaits gather() for consistency; (6) startup jitter applied only on initial connect, not on subsequent binding changes; (7) `None` sentinel instead of `sys.maxsize` for the unlimited mode; (8) bad quality published when `connect()` returns without error but `client.connected` stays False. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/714
* Adapter: Modbus TCP adapter now supports two new optional config fields: `serialize_reads` (bool, default `true`) serializes all in-flight reads via a semaphore — recommended for embedded devices that process only one request at a time; `startup_jitter_s` (float 0-300, default `30`) adds a random per-task delay before the first poll to prevent a thundering-herd burst when many bindings start simultaneously. Both options are configurable per adapter instance in the OBS UI. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/714
* Adapter: SNMP `_coerce_value` now routes `Counter64`, `Counter32`, and `Gauge32` through the `int` branch when `data_type="int"` is set explicitly, preventing these counter types from being stored as raw objects. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/707
* Adapter: KNX IP Secure now works correctly in Docker bridge networks — credentials are extracted directly from the .knxkeys file and passed explicitly to xknx, bypassing the internal UDP DescriptionRequest that fails without host networking. Connection errors now include actionable hints (Docker network mode, gateway tunnel-slot exhaustion). https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/393
* Adapter: KNX DPT10.001 (Time of Day) values are now decoded as Python `datetime.time` objects, matching the OBS `TIME` datapoint type. Persisted values are correctly restored on restart. JSON/WebSocket/MQTT/History boundaries serialize them as ISO strings; MQTT output bindings without payload template keep the backward-compatible raw payload form such as `10:30:00`. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/688
* Backend: Complete remaining UI translation fixes after i18n rollout. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/542
* Backend: Validate `DataValueEvent` payloads before bridge propagation. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/519
* Backend: Ringbuffer pause/resume race condition stabilized. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/509
* Backend: Monitor/RingBuffer now recovers automatically from a malformed SQLite database by quarantining the corrupted monitor DB/WAL/SHM files and recreating an empty RingBuffer, preventing repeated EventBus errors and Monitor API failures. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/689
* Backend: Monitor live updates now stay in sync when active filtersets are applied; WebSocket entries include RingBuffer metadata for tag matching and hierarchy-based filters trigger a server refresh instead of leaving the table stale. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/718
* Backend: InfluxDB v3 writes now use correct `db` query parameter. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/511
* Backend: The adapter page automatically reloaded every few seconds, making configuration difficult. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/394
* Backend: Fix view permissions of Demo User https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/471
* Backend: History default window changed from 24h to 7d and is now configurable via `history.default_window_hours` (Settings → Historie DB). https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/582
* Backend: KNX UF Iconset import — one-click import of all 940 KNX UF icons from ha-knx-uf-iconset directly into the icon library (prefix `kuf_`); re-import overwrites existing icons. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/677
* Backend: ETS import of password-protected .knxproj files now works correctly: Gewerke (trades) are parsed from the decrypted inner ZIP, ETS6 wrong-password errors ("Bad HMAC check") are properly reported as password errors, GA and location parsing run in parallel (non-blocking), frontend timeout raised to 300 s for large files, and error messages are fully localized via error codes. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/679
* Backend: Fixed MQTT binding edit/create dialog becoming blank when switching to write direction; adapter-type resolution and i18n handling in BindingForm were hardened. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/656
* Backend: BindingForm was split into smaller adapter-specific components, reducing future maintenance risk and noisy i18n diffs. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/657
* Backend: Settings → History DB no longer opens as an empty tab when the TimescaleDB DSN placeholder is rendered; the `@` in the PostgreSQL example is escaped for vue-i18n. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/690
* Backend: Missing i18n in several areas of the Admin GUI: all port and node labels in the Logic Engine node canvas are now fully translated and react to locale switching; the Hierarchy Manager dialog has been fully internationalised (all hardcoded German strings replaced). https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/668
* Backend: Settings → History DB no longer opens as an empty tab when the TimescaleDB DSN placeholder is rendered; the `@` in the PostgreSQL example is escaped for vue-i18n. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/690
* Backend: `PATCH /api/v1/datapoints/{id}` now correctly accepts a `value` field. The value is validated and coerced against the datapoint's `data_type` (incompatible types return 422); on success a `DataValueEvent` is published and the value is immediately readable. Explicit `"value": null` clears the stored value with `quality="uncertain"`. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/707
* Frontend: Adapter config form field labels and descriptions (Modbus TCP, SNMP, Zeitschaltuhr) are now fully i18n-translated via `SchemaForm`; the `adapterType` prop triggers locale lookups with fallback to backend schema strings. Two hardcoded German strings in the binding-migration feedback path were also replaced with `t()` calls.
* Frontend: Monitor filterset dialog now marks required fields and explains invalid value filters before saving. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/720 https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/723
* Logic engine: Fixed a threading race in `LogicManager` by iterating over stable snapshots of graph and cron-task caches while re-checking current graph state before execution or persistence, preventing repeated `dictionary changed size during iteration` errors and stale graph execution during concurrent updates. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/738
* Logic engine: The object selector now uses the entire available window space. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/345
* Logic engine: Compare nodes now honour UI-saved operator aliases (`gt`, `lt`, `eq`, `gte`, `lte`, `ne`), support the static `operand` value when the second input is not wired, and keep existing `result`/`out` edge handles compatible so downstream logic nodes receive compare results correctly. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/742
* Logic engine: Sommer/Winter (DIN) block now fills T1/T2/T3 slots correctly when sensors report at intervals that do not hit hours 7, 12, or 22 exactly (e.g. every 2 or 4 hours). "First-crossing" semantics: each slot is captured on the first measurement at or after its target hour, so daily_avg is always computed and heating mode switches reliably. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/548
* Logic engine: Functional Block "Sommer/Winter (DIN)" completely rewritten: measurement times corrected to DIN Mannheimer standard (T1 = 07:00, T2 = 14:00, T3 = 21:00); single configurable threshold temperature (default 14 °C) with hysteresis (default 2 °C) replaces separate summer/winter thresholds; heating decision based on daily average; debug ports T1/T2/T3 now persist their values after the daily average is computed; missing slots are automatically recovered from history after a server restart. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/665

* Security (Upstream PR #576): prevent SSRF/data exfiltration in iCal URL fetching by enforcing public-network URL validation and streamed size limits.
* Security (Upstream PR #563): harden Pushover `image_url` fetch against non-global targets, event-loop DNS blocking, and DNS rebinding
* Security: Preserve legacy `OPENTWS_*`/`OPENTWS_CONFIG` compatibility with case-insensitive `OBS_CONFIG` precedence and keep `opentws.db` fallback active even with partial `database.*` overrides to avoid unintended default-admin re-bootstrap on upgrades. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/554
* Security: Require admin privileges for datapoint and logic mutations. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/456
* Security: Restrict datapoint writes to widgets referenced by the current page. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/457
* Security: Restrict anonymous datapoint writes to page widget membership. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/458
* Security: Enforce admin or page-scoped authorization for datapoint writes. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/459
* Security: Stop exposing WebSocket JWTs in URL query strings. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/518
* Security: Restore public/protected viewer bootstrap reads and WebSocket connectivity without forcing JWT, reconnect page-scoped WS sessions on context changes, include WidgetRef target datapoints in anonymous allowlists, restrict anonymous WS allowlists to explicit datapoint fields, and stop passing JWT/session credentials via WS query params. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/553
* Security (Upstream PR #570): restore authenticated WebSocket access via header/subprotocol/API-key auth while keeping URL token transport disabled.
* Security: Prevent logic formula sandbox escape via custom round helper. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/504
* Security: Validate imported binding formulas to prevent untrusted formula execution. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/505
* Security: Reject active/scriptable SVG payloads on icon/config import to prevent stored XSS. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/558
* Security: Bound write-router value cache to mitigate MQTT payload-retention DoS risk. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/524
* Security (Upstream PR #528): harden AST sandboxing in the logic executor to prevent sandbox escapes.
* Security: Harden SVG icon import sanitization (obfuscated javascript href, deep nesting guard, stable `<svg>` serialization, blocked SMIL animation tags, and DOCTYPE rejection), make ZIP imports atomic on sanitize errors, preserve API-key flows across username changes, and allow imports for authenticated users. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/555
* Security: Harden LXC first-boot and release handling (per-container JWT secret, stricter env/tag handling). https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/455 https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/506 https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/512

* Security: Logic API-client nodes, iCalendar nodes, Pushover image attachments, camera proxy requests, and weather API requests now share an admin-managed URL target allowlist for deliberate access to internal destinations while keeping SSRF protection active. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/700
* Security (Upstream PR #686): API client secret-file paths are restricted to a configured secret directory with bounded regular-file reads.
* Test stability: Monitor/Ringbuffer E2E scenarios stabilized. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/494
* Visu: Internal API base URL usage fixed for E2E/runtime alignment. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/484
* Visu: History widget now updates automatically when new values arrive via WebSocket. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/408
* Visu: WebSocket subscriptions now immediately receive the current registry values, so viewers show values again right after reconnects or page changes instead of waiting for the next adapter poll. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/749
* Visu: History widget now uses aggregated history buckets for multi-day ranges, so periods up to "last 90 days" remain complete and render efficiently instead of only showing the newest 24 hours. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/692
* Visu: RTR Widget now use correct values for room controller (heating) DPT 20.102 https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/461
